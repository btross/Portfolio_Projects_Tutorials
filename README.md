With labs have a write up at seperate sections: difficulties, adjustments, what I learned etc

Brendan's Personal Wiki – README
This wiki is my personal knowledge base and lab notebook. It's designed to help me stay organized and focused as I work toward certifications, career goals, and technical growth.


🧭 Purpose

Certifications & Career Roadmaps
Tracking progress, planning next steps, and organizing resources for cybersecurity certifications and long-term career transitions (Cloud Security, Security Architecture, etc).

Networking & Security
Notes, diagrams, commands, and walkthroughs related to networking fundamentals, security tools, protocols, and threat modeling.

Labs & Projects
Homelab setups, experiments, and configs across Windows, Linux, cloud platforms, and automation tools. Includes:

Tenable VM / ASM / WAS
SentinelOne / IDP
Prowler CSPM
Elastic Stack
Multi-OS endpoint setups
PowerShell / Bash scripting
IoT & automation
Terms to Look Up
Quick definitions or deeper dives into acronyms, tools, techniques, and concepts I come across during work, study, or labbing.



🛠️ How I Use It

Jot down what I learn, break down complex topics, and link out to good resources.
Track what I’ve tried, what worked, what didn’t.
Keep a running list of “look this up later” terms.
Use it as a launchpad for deeper research or labbing.


📁 Structure Ideas (Optional)

/certs/ – Certification notes, study plans, and progress tracking
/career/ – Roadmaps, goals, and role-specific skills
/networking/ – Protocols, diagrams, troubleshooting
/security/ – Tools, techniques, threat modeling
/labs/ – Homelab configs, walkthroughs, automation
/glossary/ – Terms and acronyms to look up


This is mostly for me, so it doesn’t need to be perfect—just useful.
