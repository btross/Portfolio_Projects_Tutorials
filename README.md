Brendan's Personal Wiki ‚Äì README
This wiki is my personal knowledge base and lab notebook. It‚Äôs meant to help me stay organized and focused as I work toward certs, career goals, and technical growth. Here's what it's for:
üß≠ Purpose


Certifications & Career Roadmaps
Tracking progress, planning next steps, and organizing resources for cybersecurity certs and career transitions (especially toward Cloud Security & Security Architecture).


Networking & Security
Notes, diagrams, commands, and walkthroughs related to networking fundamentals, security tools, protocols, and threat modeling.


Labs & Projects
Homelab setups, experiments, and configs across Windows, Linux, cloud platforms, and automation tools. Includes stuff like:

Tenable VM/ASM/WAS
SentinelOne/IDP
Prowler CSPM
Elastic Stack
Multi-OS endpoint setups
PowerShell/Bash scripting
IoT & automation



Terms to Look Up
Quick definitions or deeper dives into acronyms, tools, techniques, and concepts I come across.


üõ†Ô∏è How I Use It

Jot down what I learn, break down complex topics, and link out to good resources.
Track what I‚Äôve tried, what worked, what didn‚Äôt.
Keep a running list of ‚Äúlook this up later‚Äù terms.
Use it as a launchpad for deeper research or labbing.
